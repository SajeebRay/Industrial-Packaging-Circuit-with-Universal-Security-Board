## **Project Name: Industrial-Packaging-Circuit-with-Universal-Security-Board!** <br>
_This device enables industrials to offer trial run of their hardware.
Also, it will enhance the EMI system. 
This circuit uses security system, using the security password the customer can start the machine.
There we use three passwords, two for 15 days trial run. And, one for pro-password, using this the device will run forever._
